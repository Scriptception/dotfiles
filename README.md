# dotfiles

A repository for my dotfiles. Feel free to use and share.

## 🌟 Features

- **Window Manager**: bspwm with sxhkd for keybindings.
- **Terminal**: Alacritty with tmux.
- **Editor**: Neovim (LazyVim based) with **Gemini CLI** integration.
- **Theme**: dynamic colors using pywal.

# Tips

- Use `wal -i <IMAGE>` to generate colourscheme from your image.
- Use the wallset script to apply it to the bspwm system.
- In Neovim, use `<leader>a/` to toggle the **Gemini CLI** terminal.
